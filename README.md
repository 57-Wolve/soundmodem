# Soundmodem 0.16

## Soundmodem 0.16 now compiles with GCC5!

This software appears to have been abandoned by it's authors, and I have 
uploaded it here as I continue to tidy up the code and work on it.

I will be adding features from versions 0.18 and 0.2 as time goes on, as 
v0.18 and above break compatability with quite a few radios, including 
my own - the venerable FT-857D.

This version throws compilation errors when compiling with GCC5 and 
above, so fixing this will be my first task - then I plan on removing 
all of the crazy externs in the code and tidying up.

Offers of help are welcome.

Soundmodem is a driver and userspace utilities for using a sound card as 
a packet radio modem (TNC).
